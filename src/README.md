# Spring MVC Film CRUD

# Description:
This a full stack application using Spring MVC and applying CRUD. On start up you are on a screen that shows that you are in SD Film Database. You have the option to search by Film ID or Keyword. When you search by the film ID, it will show what film matches that ID, or if you search by keyword, it will show you what films match that keyword.
There is an option on the welcome page where you can add a film that you create. You would have to enter the title, description, release year, language, rental duration, rental rate, length, replacement cost, rating, and special features or it will not let you hit submit. 
When searching, if there is a film in the database that matches, then you will be able to see the film ID, title, description, the year it was released, language, how many days you can rent the film, what the rental rate is, how long the film is, what the replacement cost is if you lose it, and the rating. Next it will list the actors for that film if there were any. 
If no film matches you get sent to an error page. 
The options on the successful search page will then ask if you want to delete or edit the film. 
If you try to delete a movie that has already existed in the database that you have not added, it will not let you delete it. However if you create a movie and then try to delete it, you will be able to. 

If you choose to edit the film all the information of the selected film is shown already and you can pick and choose what you'd like to edit. Once done, you hit submit and it takes you back to the same page where you can see the changes you've made. You'll be prompted with the same options of deleting or editing.

# Lessons Learned:
On this project we learned the importance of communication and how to work as a team. This was definitely a difficult project since it was the fist time that we used a webform to get information rather than using a scanner and getting information from the console. We learned a lot about mapping the information. 
I had a hard time with being able to view what was added to the database, but after problem solving we discovered it was user error on my part! ~ Lauren. 
It was really good to see how all of this stuff comes together. It was very interesting! ~ Sam
We at first thought that this project was going to be a walk in the park, but over 50 commits later... we realized it was not. 
Once it was working, that was a great feeling and being able to put the pieces together, even if we may have had to shove them into place.
